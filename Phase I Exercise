There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot? 

==================================================================================================================
KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 1984
•	What operating system does it run? CP/M 2.2 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? Then: $1595-$1615. Now: ~$3600. How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). This was semmingly difficult to locate on the secondhand market. Other Kaypro versions were more readily available, but not many Kaypro 4 models specifically. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? The Kaypro 4 was probably the most difficult for me to actually navigate. It's software seemed like "Unfamiliar territory." The small screen also drove me insane, however, it did make it seem more portable or durable. mm 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

===================================================================================================================
APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 1983
•	What operating system does it run? OS 3.3
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
   Then: ~$2100 Now: ~$6000 There were a vareity of listings on both Ebay and Craigslist. Ebay had the more expensive listings. Those seemed to be the best in terms of being "refurbished."
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  I had a much more comfortable experience with the Apple IIe. I felt like my participation was necessary to make the os work to its full cacpacity. I think Apple (like they continue to do) attempts to make its users feel like they can be their own experts if they just spend a brief amount of time learning the ropes. I enjoyed this user experience more so than the Kaypro 4, as that made me feel like I had a very little grasp on technology. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

====================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 1987
•	What operating system does it run? MacOS (3.3-3.4, 4.0–6.0.2, 6.0.3–6.0.8, 7.0-7.5.5) [from Wikipedia]
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Then: ~$2900 (w/ dual floppy) or ~$3900 with 20 MB hard drive Now: ~$6074 or ~$8168. The SE was fairly easy to locate on the secondhand market, as both EBay and Craigslist has multiple listings. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
 The small monitor on the SE also drove me crazy! Still, I think this was far easier to navigate than the Apple IIe or the Kaypro. In a way it seemed to possess the same experience of navigating a tablet; you know everything is there, but it's just a matter of seeking out the information you need using a different kind of map. I like that the SE had a desktop, as this was familiar to me. 


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
  This seemed to have the traditional Mac desktop/start menu items; otherwise I just looked at Marble Springs. 

===================================================================================================================
VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 1982
•	What operating system does it run? The OS seemingly ran on a 8 in. floppy disk. I don't know how this compares to other operating systems, as it seems utterly external. 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Then: ~$100-$300 Now: $246-$739. Ebay did have listings of seperate parts, but there were very few listings of the system in its entirety. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  According to a a variety of users, the Vectrex seemed to be a singular machine. It had animation as well as audio and seound effects. This differentiated it from almost every other game machine. Vector graphics also allowed players to migrate the systems into their homes and own gaming consoles--although exactly how this took place, I'm still unsure. 
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
  It seems this was in accordance with the other games that were coming out at the time. Vector graphics can maintain a higher quality no matter how high or low they are scaled. 

===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 1985
•	What operating system does it run? AmigaOS 1.0
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Then ~$1295 Now: ~$2836. Ebay had a few listings, but mostly the parts versus the Amiga in its entirety. There were also other auctions (if you just search "Amiga for sale") and the prices varied drastically. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  The experience with Amiga was far different than that of the other machines. Historically it seems to have crashed quite a bit (from user reviews online). The graphics did seem more enhanced, which made the experience "better" (at least compared to the other machines).  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
  Amiga Appetizer was interesting as a WP, as I thought it was very hard to configure in terms of usage. I was very surprised by the composing system!

===================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 1989
•	What operating system does it run? System 6.0.4-System 7.1.1(Pro), System 7.5-Mac OS 7.6.1 [from Wikipedia]
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Then: ~$6269 (what?!) Now: ~$12029 (what again!?). Ebay had only a few listings; like other machines, it was offered in parts versus the IIci in its entirety. Craigslist has similar listings (in part). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  Many reviewers have emphasized that the IIci contained much more power and capability than previous models while still being the same size. Speed was also something articulated within the reviews, which is something I think that we still hold in very high regard now. In other words, that seems to be the most common frustation with Mac/PC users as of now. The cost to me was, of course, tremendous, which made me consider the market space that Apple created for itself at the time, and has continued to do so. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
  I think I liked MS Word better because it seemed more familiar to me. Still, I had little trouble acquainting myself with WordPerfect. I was thinking about how the best features of these two systems have both merged and grown apart over the years (for example, Pages, TextEdit, and Word, etc.). 
  I was somwhat shocked by how much information this machine contained about the previous user. Someone with the name of Rough utilized this machine to make flyers, brochures, other print media, and keep track of information.
